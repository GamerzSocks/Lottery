# Lottery
A Python game that lets you play the Lottery once per day, pick 6 numbers and see if you are lucky!

# Setup
The game comes with 2 files, lottery.py and GAMEDATA.txt. GAMEDATA.txt is basically your save data. It keeps track of the amount of wins you have, the last time you played, and the winning numbers for your wins. MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY!
